What is 3D G-Code?

After you create a 3D model, the printer requires a converted file so that it knows how to print the model correctly.  As such, it requires the stl file to be tranformed to g-code.  GCode is fundamentally a set of longitude and latitude coordinates that the printer uses to print the model from the bottom up.  It's pretty ingenious.

One of the most common slicers is [Cura](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura).  I recommend downloading it (it's free) and then importing your STL file.

Then, after it appears, click on Slice, and it will create a new file for you with the extension gcode.

Save the file.  Then, right-click and open it in VS Code or Atom.

What do you see?  Is it a lot of numbers?  However, for the printer, it makes a lot of sense. It prints the bottom first and then builds on top of each layer.
