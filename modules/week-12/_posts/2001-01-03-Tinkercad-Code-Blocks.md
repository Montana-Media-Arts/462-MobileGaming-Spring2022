TinkerCad also gives us the ability to use code to build 3D shapes and creations.  We are going to explore those as well. 

First, go to the following link.

* [TinkerCad Code Blocks](https://www.tinkercad.com/dashboard?type=codeblocks&collection=designs)

Then, click on Create New Code Block.  When the dialog box appears, click on **Intro to Shapes** activities.

Go through the activity so that you know how to code blocks add 3D shapes.

Then, go through the **Moving Shapes** tutorial and then finally, the **Rotating Shapes** tutorial.

For your portion, click on **New Design** and create something that introduces new shapes, and have them do something like move around and rotate.  Try something fun.

Don't worry; it will automatically save.
