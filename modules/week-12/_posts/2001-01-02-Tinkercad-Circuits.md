# Circuits

<a href="https://umontana.zoom.us/rec/play/tMZ_ceCq-D03HNfB4gSDA6MtW9W6J6mshHAZ-KVeyx6xViZVMVSiZ7ETYLfN0k7VVAIQHGSECLI24vzH?continueMode=true" target="_new">Video</a>

The first section we are going to cover is circuits.  I know they were pesky things and finicky.  Let's see how it works in a simulation instead.

Go to the following link.

* [TinkerCad Circuits](https://www.tinkercad.com/dashboard?type=circuits&collection=designs)

After you get there, click on the Try Circuits.

In the first simulation, you should have something that looks familiar.  There is a LED light, a battery, a resistor, and some wires connecting them all.

Go through the first simulation walkthrough and make sure the LED light turns on.

Continue through the next simulation on editing to see if you can make the appropriate alterations.

Then, go through the wiring components tutorials and see if you can get that work properly.

Finally, go through the adding components tutorial and make sure you understand that one.

For your activity in this one, can you get the basic LED to turn with an Arduino UNO and a breadboard?  Can you add a push button as well?  

The beautiful part about classrooms is that I can see your progress, so do not worry; I will know if you are having any issues.  Please let me know how I can help.  At least you won't have to worry about the tiny wires and having them break. :)
