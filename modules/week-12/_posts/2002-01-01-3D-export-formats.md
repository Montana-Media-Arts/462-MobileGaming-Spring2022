# Exporting 3D Models

So, now that you created your 3D model, how do we get it to the printer?

There are a couple of steps that we must follow.  In TinkerCad, you click on the **Export** button.

From there, you have three options, .obj, .stl and .glb for 3D Printing.

What is the difference? Might you ask?

* .obj - as per [all3dp.com](https://all3dp.com) they explain it like this.  The OBJ file format is one of the most important file formats in 3D printing and 3D graphics applications. It is the preferred format for multi-color 3D printing and widely used as a neutral interchange format for non-animated 3D models in graphics applications.

For more details, follow this link. [obj explained](https://all3dp.com/1/obj-file-format-3d-printing-cad/)

* .stl - conversely as per [3dprintingforbeginners](https://3dprintingforbeginners.com/stl-and-obj-files-101/) states stl as follows. .STL format is one of the most commonly used file formats for 3D printing. It is because most CAD software has the feature of exporting models in the .stl form, and most 3D printers support it. The file generates the surface geometry of the modeled object only. 

They talk about obj here too.

* .glb - although not really well know, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GlTF#GLB) (I know. Sorry about that.), describes it like this. GLB file format is a binary form of glTF that includes textures instead of referencing them as external images. The .glb files are required in Facebook 3D Posts.

After you have exported your 3D model into one of these formats, you still need to convert into something that the printer can recognize.

Continue one to find out what that is!
