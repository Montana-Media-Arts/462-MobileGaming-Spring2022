<br />
Now that we have some experience developing a game, let's develop something a little more complex!

## Design Document

Before we jump into designing and programming our next game, we need to think about the features and other aspects. This usually begins with a design document(GDD) for any major project. In the interest of moving along quickly, here's a simple example:

 	 
- Game Title	Star Explorer â€” a space shooter game.
- Description	Maneuver your starship through an asteroid field, destroying asteroids as you progress.
- Controls	Tap on the ship to fire; drag the ship to move left and right.
- Sounds	Shooting sound and explosion sound when the ship collides with an asteroid.
Now we have a very basic outline for our game. Once the design document is created, you'll be surprised at how quickly it grows!
