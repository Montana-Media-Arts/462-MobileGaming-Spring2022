# Add Platforms

Next, we will add platforms so that when we compile our applications it will create the application as expected.

**Note: if you want an iOS application, it must be installed and created on a machine with MacOS.

After creating a Cordova project, navigate to the project directory. From the project directory, you need to add a platform for which you want to build your app.

To add a platform, type **cordova platform add <platform name>**.

For a complete list of platforms you can add, run **cordova platform**.
