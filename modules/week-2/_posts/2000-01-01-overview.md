Solar2D is a Lua based game engine with focus on ease of iterations and usage
This is a fully open source project that is forked of the well established and widely used Corona SDK game engine, which is no longer commercially supported. Development is lead by Vlad Shcherban, former technical lead engineer at Corona Labs Inc. If you are using this engine, consider supporting its development.
