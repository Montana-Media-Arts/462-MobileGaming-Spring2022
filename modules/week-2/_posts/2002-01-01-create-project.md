# Create a Project

We are going to create a simple tap-based game to keep a balloon in the air, along with covering some of the basics of game development. We will keep this first project as simple as possible for those who are new or have been away from programming for a while.

## Using Solar2D

### Scripting

Solar2D uses Lua scripting language. If you've ever programmed in any language, you will find Lua an easy transition. Introduction to Lua guide provides an overview of Lua, or you can learn Lua on YouTube. In a very short time, you will find yourself writing that great app that you've dreamed of creating!

If you're completely new to programming, Lua is still easy to learn and this guide will help you along.

## Text Editors

In addition to Solar2D, you will need a text editor. There are several editors available and choosing one is much like choosing a car — everybody has their own preferences and you should explore which one suits you best.

## Creating a project

Your first project is going to be very simple, but it will demonstrate some important concepts. We are going to make a simple tapping game to keep a balloon in the air. Each time the balloon is tapped, we will "push" it a little higher.

### Notes

The best way to use this guide is to follow every step — type in the code, add the images, and see your project gradually come to life. It may take a little more time, but you will gain a much better understanding.

Included with each chapter is a downloadable file which contains all of the images, audio files, and other assets related to that chapter. This chapter's source files are available here.

## Starting a Project

Creating a new project in Solar2D is easy. In just a few simple steps you'll be ready to make your first game!

1. Open the Solar2D Simulator.

2. Click New Project from the welcome window or select New Project... from the File menu.

3. For the project/application name, type BalloonTap and ensure that the Blank template option is selected. Leave the other settings at default and click OK (Windows) or Next (Mac). This will create the basic files for your first game in the location (folder) that you specified. This is also the folder in which you'll place all of your app files/assets, including images, program files, etc.

## Including Images

For this project, you will need three image files, placed within the BalloonTap project folder created above.  [Source Files](https://github.com/coronalabs/GettingStarted01/archive/master.zip)
