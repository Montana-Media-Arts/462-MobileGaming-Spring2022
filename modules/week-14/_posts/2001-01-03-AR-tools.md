There are a lot of tools out there that will help you create augmented reality experiences.

One that has gained a lot of popularity on iOS is Adobe Aero.

If you have an iOS device, I encourage you to try this out. You can add characters, give them functionality, and then record your screen.

Example here.

Another one that is out there for both devices is Google Expeditions.

Another mobile AR app is called Sketch AR, which allows you to take existing photographs and make them into an AR experience, or you can draw something and transform it into an AR Experience.

Finally, we will also look at a desktop program that allows us to create AR experiences that can be view on our phone. It's called Vuforia.  It is quite robust, but it gives us the ability to import 3D objects, images, text, and more and then create an AR experience from that without any code.  Watch the video below on how to get everything installed.
