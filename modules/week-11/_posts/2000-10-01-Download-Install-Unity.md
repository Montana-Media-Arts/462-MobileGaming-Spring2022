Unity uses centralized software called the Unity Hub, allowing users to install different versions of Unity on the same machine.  The Unity Hub allows you to support today's projects from today as well as ones in the future or even previous projects.

1. First go to Unity [Unity](https://unity.com/)
2. Next, Click on **Games**
3. Click on **Get Started**.
4. Click the **Individual Tab**.
5. Click the **Student** or **Individual Sign up** button.
6. If you choose **Individual**, click **Start Here**.
7. Click **Agree and Download**.
8. After the download is complete, install **Unity Hub**.


# Install Unity

Once you have the Unity Hub, you can install different versions of Unity.  I recommend the latest one.


1. In the Unity Hub, click **Installs**.
2. Click **Add**.
3. Select the most recent version (should be on top) and click **Next**.
4. In the **Add Modules** window, select either **Windows Build Support** or **Mac Build Support**.
5. Click **Done**.

Wait for the install and then click on Projects.

1. Click **New**.
2. In the **Create New Project**, click **2D Template**.
3. In the **Project Name**, enter **Playground Fun** (or whatever you want)
4. Click **Create**.
