In this assignment, you are going to implement your video into p5js and see how it looks in the browser.

1. Make sure you have a local copy of p5.js
2. Make sure you have a tour video  (of anything you want) created, edited, and ready for integration.
3. Create an assets folder and add your video.
4. Double-check that your video plays by opening your .html file with Live Server.
5. Upload everything to your GitHub repository.
6. Submit your GitHub link to Moodle.

Here is my example video that I took this week.  I thought it would be interesting and therapeutic to film where I walk my dog every day.  I wanted to tell the story of how our town feels empty with the parks closed and the streets abandoned.
