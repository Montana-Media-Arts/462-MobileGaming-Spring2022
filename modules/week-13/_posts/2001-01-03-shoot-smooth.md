# Shoot Smooth and Steady

Watching a bumpy video can be disorienting, and so we want to employ techniques to help with that.  

Below is a video where things have gone a little wrong.

Now, how can we fix this? We can keep our elbows in close to our body or set the camera on a fixed surface to keep things more stable.

* Keep in mind your camera often has an option to help with anti-shaking, and a lot of video producers will try and help with this too.
