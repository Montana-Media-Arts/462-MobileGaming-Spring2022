# Class Project

This semester, we have been asked to work in collaboration with another institution. We are building a game that teaches students about majors at a university.  We have a few things we must determine.

* What do we need to do?
* What is the subject matter?
* What roles does everyone want to play?
* How much prior knowledge do we have?
* How much time do we have?
* What is realistic?
* Who is our main point of contact?
* What technology are we going to use?
* Who will keep track of everything?
* When will we meet to discuss progress?
* Does this sound fun?
