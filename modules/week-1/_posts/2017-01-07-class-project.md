# Class Project

This semester, we are creating a gamified augmented reality campus tour for the University of Montana.

* What do we need to do?
* What is the subject matter?
* What roles does everyone want to play?
* How much prior knowledge do we have?
* How much time do we have?
* What is realistic?
* Who is our main point of contact?
* What technology are we going to use?
* Who will keep track of everything?
* When will we meet to discuss progress?
* Does this sound fun?
